[NYC open data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)
===========

This is my prelimary approach to answer random questions in my life using nyc open data plus other public data:
<ol>
<li>How is the health condition distribution along the subway line?[1]</li>
<li>Where can I park for free next to Central Park during the weekends?</li>
<li>How is the day care I am sending my child to?</li>
<li>Where to find the best housing for my family?</li>
<li>How safe/unsafe is my neighborhood?</li>
</ol>
